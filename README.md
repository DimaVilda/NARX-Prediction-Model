# NARX-Prediction-Model
Two implementations of NARX Prediction Model

Here you can find two implementations of the NARX model to predict the temperature in the room. 
The first model is based on neural networks and is written with the help of the PyNeurGen library. 
The second NARX model is a polynomial model, written on the basis of an article by a professor at the Polytechnic Institute of Milan Luigi Piroddi(for more information write to me in my mail) 
Several datasets were used for experiments. To change the dataset file in the program, simply comment the line with the old data set and recomment on a line with another data set.
The peculiarity of the NARKS model is that it is very sensitive to temporary data, so the experiment used real data and time.
